# DeepVisionProject
contains approach to train a classifier that distinguishes between
cats and dogs. We tested several models of different depth and structure from scratch
with a dataset including 25000 labeled images. A accuracy up to 87 % after 15 epochs of
training was achieved. This could be increased by repeat training for more epochs or by
increasing the image size. Better results up to 99.44% were achieved when using transfer
learning based on a pretrained ResNet34 model.
